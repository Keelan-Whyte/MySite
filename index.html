        <h2>Hi, I'm Keelan</h2>
        <p>
          I am 26 years old, currently working in the Film and Television
          Industry. This website is my test ground as I begin my Software
          Development Journey.

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
            I have been programming for a couple weeks now and have a good grasp
            of HTML and CSS. I am still working with intermediate CSS and will
            begin JavaScript soon. From there I will move on to Frameworks such
            as Bootstrap and React.

          <h3>VFX Compositing</h3>
          <p>
            Through my time as a Video Playback Operator in Film and Television,
            I had the pleasure of assisting the Director, Cinematographer and
            VFX department with live composites. This would include Keying,
            Garbage Matting, Mix and Overlay. As well as compositing multiple
            layers of footage together, often off-setting the camera movement
            and playback speeds.

          <h3>Problem Solving & Intuition</h3>
          <p>
            I have always been a problem solver. I have a natural intuition for
            thinking of the most effective and efficient solution to a problem.
            When faced with a issue that I can not solve, I am open to new ideas
            and ways of thinking. It's important to admit when you don't know
            something and to be open to constant learning and growing.
